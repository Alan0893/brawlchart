2. In your package.json, add `"brawlchart": "file:brawlchart"` in your dependencies
3. You have now installed the package!

```javascript
const brawlchart = require("brawlchart")        //includes the brawlchart module
const token      = "Your Token"                 //your unique API token
const client     = new brawlchart.Client(token) //creates a new brawlchart Client
