const brawlchart = require("brawlchart")        //includes the brawlchart module
const token      = "Your Token"                 //your unique API token
const client     = new brawlchart.Client(token) //creates a new brawlchart Client

;(async() => {
  const player     = await client.getPlayer("#PLAYERTAG") //Fetches a player stats as given in the parameter
